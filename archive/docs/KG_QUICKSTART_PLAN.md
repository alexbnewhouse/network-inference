# Knowledge Graph Enhancement: Quick Start Plan

**Goal**: Make KGs production-ready for social science research  
**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks  
**Date**: October 21, 2025

---

## üéØ Top 3 Immediate Priorities

### 1. Temporal Knowledge Graphs (Week 1-2) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why**: Can't study narrative evolution without time  
**What**: Track entities over time, detect events, time-slice relationships  
**Effort**: 2 weeks  
**Impact**: HIGH - unlocks 80% of social science use cases

### 2. Sentiment & Stance (Week 2-3) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why**: Need to know HOW entities are discussed, not just that they're mentioned  
**What**: Add sentiment scores to entities and edges  
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Impact**: HIGH - enables polarization & framing research

### 3. User-Entity Bridge (Week 3-4) ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why**: Connect KG to social network analysis  
**What**: Bipartite network showing who discusses what  
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH - bridges two research paradigms

## üöÄ Quick Wins (Do Today/Tomorrow)

### Quick Win #1: Add Basic Time Grouping (2 hours)
```python
# Add to kg_cli.py:
--group-by-time daily|weekly|monthly
--time-col created_at
```
Outputs separate KG files per time period.

### Quick Win #2: Entity Metadata (1 hour)
Add to nodes.csv:
- first_context: sample text where entity appears
- n_contexts: # of unique documents mentioning it

### Quick Win #3: Auto-generated Report (2 hours)
Create kg_report.md with:
- Entity type distributions
- Top entities
- Relation statistics
- Quality warnings

### Quick Win #4: Simple Sentiment (3 hours)
```bash
pip install vaderSentiment
# Add --add-sentiment flag
```
Output: entity_sentiment.csv with per-entity scores

**Total effort: 8 hours (1 day)**

---

## üìà Current State vs. Desired State

### Current Capabilities ‚úÖ
- Extract entities (PERSON, ORG, GPE, etc.)
- Find co-occurrences within character windows
- Extract ~15 dependency relations per 1000 posts
- Output clean CSV files
- 77 entities from 2000 posts (4chan data)
- No NaN issues, no case duplicates, no self-loops

### Critical Gaps ‚ùå
1. **No temporal analysis** - can't track narrative evolution
2. **No sentiment** - don't know how entities are framed
3. **Isolated from social networks** - can't connect "who" to "what"
4. **Limited relation types** - only verbs, no causation/stance/framing
5. **No quality metrics** - can't validate extraction
6. **Weak documentation** - not accessible to non-experts

---

## üìä What This Enables for Research

### Before (Current State)
**Q**: "Who are the main actors in this dataset?"  
**A**: List of 77 entities with frequencies  
**Limitation**: Static snapshot, no evolution, no context

### After (Week 4)
**Q**: "How did discussion of China evolve during the Ukraine conflict?"  
**A**: 
- Timeline showing China mentions spike Feb 2022
- Sentiment shifts from neutral to negative
- New entity associations: China‚ÜíRussia, China‚ÜíUkraine
- Top users driving the narrative
- Cross-community differences in framing

### After (Week 8)
**Q**: "What conspiracy theories link vaccines to other entities?"  
**A**:
- Entity chain patterns (Vaccine‚ÜíPfizer‚ÜíGates‚ÜíControl)
- Sentiment analysis (increasingly negative over time)
- Bridge entities connecting different communities
- Temporal clustering of coordinated mentions
- User network analysis showing spreaders

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
src/semantic/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kg_pipeline.py          # Core (already good)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kg_temporal.py          # NEW - Week 1-2
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kg_sentiment.py         # NEW - Week 2-3
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_entity_network.py  # NEW - Week 3-4
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kg_validator.py         # NEW - Week 5-6
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ relation_patterns.py    # NEW - Week 5-6

src/semantic/cli/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kg_cli.py              # Update with new features
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kg_temporal_cli.py     # NEW
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user_entity_cli.py     # NEW
```

### API Design
```python
# Current (simple)
kg = KnowledgeGraphPipeline()
kg.run(df, "output/")

# After (extensible)
from src.semantic.kg_pipeline import KnowledgeGraphPipeline
from src.semantic.kg_temporal import add_temporal_features
from src.semantic.kg_sentiment import add_sentiment

kg = KnowledgeGraphPipeline()
nodes, edges = kg.run(df, "output/")

# Add temporal
nodes, edges = add_temporal_features(nodes, edges, df, time_col='created_at')

# Add sentiment
nodes, edges = add_sentiment(nodes, edges, df)
```
