## üìä Current State Audit

### ‚úÖ What Works Well

**Core Infrastructure:**
- ‚úÖ Solid KG extraction pipeline (`kg_pipeline.py`)
- ‚úÖ Named Entity Recognition with spaCy
- ‚úÖ Entity normalization and filtering
- ‚úÖ Co-occurrence detection (character windows)
- ‚úÖ Dependency-based relation extraction
- ‚úÖ Multiple output formats (CSV, graph formats)
- ‚úÖ Good integration with existing semantic network tools

**Recent Improvements (Oct 2025):**
- ‚úÖ NaN/null handling
- ‚úÖ Case consistency (no duplicates)
- ‚úÖ Self-loop prevention
- ‚úÖ False positive filtering (AI, CEO, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced entity type filtering

**Quality on Real Data (4chan test):**
- 77 entities from 2000 posts (min_freq=5)
- 311 edges (281 co-occurrence + 30 dependency)
- 0 self-loops, 0 case duplicates
- Avg degree: 8.08 (good connectivity)

### ‚ùå Critical Gaps for Social Science

- Can't track how narratives evolve over time
- No entity lifecycle tracking (emergence, peak, decline)
- Missing temporal edge weights (relationship strength over time)
- No event detection or timeline construction

**2. Limited Semantic Depth** üß†
- Only extracts "co-occurrence" and verb-based relations
- Missing: causation, sentiment, stance, framing
- No entity disambiguation (multiple "America" entities)
- No entity linking to knowledge bases (Wikidata, etc.)

**3. No Social Network Integration** üë•
- KG and actor networks are completely separate
- Can't answer: "Who discusses which entities?"
- Missing: user-entity bipartite networks
- No community-entity analysis

**4. Insufficient Validation Tools** ‚úì
- No inter-rater reliability metrics
- No entity extraction quality scores
- Missing: false positive/negative analysis
- No benchmarking against gold standard datasets

**5. Limited Scale & Performance** ‚ö°
- Dependency parsing doesn't scale (30 relations from 2000 posts)
- No incremental/streaming processing
- Memory-intensive for >100K documents
- No distributed processing support

**6. Missing Analysis Features** üìà
- No centrality metrics tailored to KGs
- No narrative/conspiracy detection
- No controversy scoring
- No entity polarization analysis
- No cross-community bridging analysis

**7. Weak Documentation for Social Scientists** üìö
- No worked examples with research questions
- Missing: "how to interpret PPMI for entities"
- No replication guides
- Limited troubleshooting for domain-specific data

---

## üéØ Strategic Priorities

### Tier 1: Must-Have for Social Science (1-2 weeks)

#### 1.1 Temporal Knowledge Graphs ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Impact**: HIGH - Essential for studying narrative evolution, events, campaigns

**Implementation:**
```python
class TemporalKG:
    """Extend KG with temporal features."""
    
    def extract_temporal_entities(self, df):
        """Track entity first/last appearance, frequency over time."""
        # Output: entity_timeline.csv with columns:
        # [entity, type, first_seen, last_seen, peak_time, 
        #  total_mentions, unique_days, lifespan_days]
    
    def build_temporal_edges(self, df, time_window='1D'):
        """Build time-sliced KG edges."""
        # Output: edges_temporal.csv with columns:
        # [source, target, relation_type, time_period, weight]
    
    def detect_entity_events(self, df, threshold=2.0):
        """Detect sudden spikes in entity mentions (events)."""
        # Output: events.csv with columns:
        # [entity, event_date, baseline_freq, spike_freq, 
        #  z_score, context_sample]
```

**Files to create:**
- `src/semantic/kg_temporal.py` - Core temporal KG class
- `src/semantic/kg_temporal_cli.py` - CLI interface
- `examples/temporal_kg_example.ipynb` - Tutorial notebook

**Tests needed:**
- Entity lifecycle tracking
- Time-sliced edge weights
- Event detection accuracy

---

#### 1.2 Entity Sentiment & Stance ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Impact**: HIGH - Critical for studying framing, polarization, controversy

**Implementation:**
```python
class SentimentKG:
    """Add sentiment/stance to KG edges."""
    
    def compute_entity_sentiment(self, df):
        """Sentiment of contexts mentioning entity."""
        # Output: entity_sentiment.csv
        # [entity, avg_sentiment, sentiment_std, 
        #  controversy_score, n_contexts]
    
    def compute_edge_sentiment(self, df, edges):
        """Sentiment of contexts containing both entities."""
        # Output: edges_with_sentiment.csv
        # [source, target, relation_type, weight,
        #  avg_sentiment, sentiment_variance]
    
    def detect_controversial_entities(self, threshold=0.3):
        """Find entities with high sentiment variance."""
        # Output: controversial_entities.csv
```

**Method options:**
1. **Simple**: TextBlob or VADER (lexicon-based)
2. **Better**: Fine-tuned transformers (twitter-roberta-base-sentiment)
3. **Best**: Domain-specific fine-tuning on labeled data

**Files to create:**
- `src/semantic/kg_sentiment.py`
- Integration into main `kg_pipeline.py`

---

#### 1.3 User-Entity Bipartite Networks ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Bridge between KG and social network analysis

**Implementation:**
```python
class UserEntityNetwork:
    """Build bipartite networks: users ‚Üî entities."""
    
    def build_bipartite(self, df):
        """Create user-entity network."""
        # Output: user_entity_edges.csv
        # [user_id, entity, entity_type, n_mentions, 
        #  first_mention, last_mention]
    
    def project_to_user_network(self):
        """Users connected by shared entities."""
        # Output: user_user_edges.csv
        # [source_user, target_user, shared_entities, 
        #  jaccard_similarity]
    
    def project_to_entity_network(self):
        """Entities connected by shared users."""
        # Similar output with entity pairs
```

**Use cases:**
- Who discusses China? (user ‚Üí entity)
- Which users discuss similar entities? (user projection)
- Which entities are discussed by same communities? (entity projection)

**Files to create:**
- `src/semantic/user_entity_network.py`
- Integration with existing `actor_network.py`

---

### Tier 2: Important Enhancements (2-4 weeks)

#### 2.1 Advanced Relation Extraction ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Current problem**: Only 30 dependency relations from 2000 posts (0.015 per post)

**Solutions:**
1. **Rule-based patterns** (fast, reliable)
   ```python
   RELATION_PATTERNS = {
       'causal': ['cause', 'lead to', 'result in', 'because of'],
       'opposes': ['against', 'opposes', 'fights', 'versus'],
       'supports': ['supports', 'backs', 'endorses', 'favors'],
       'owns': ['owns', 'possesses', 'has', 'controls'],
       'member': ['member of', 'part of', 'belongs to'],
   }
   ```

2. **OpenIE integration** (more relations, noisier)
   - Use Stanford OpenIE or AllenNLP OpenIE
   - Extract (subject, predicate, object) triples
   - Filter by entity types

3. **Transformer-based relation extraction** (best quality, slowest)
   - Fine-tune BERT for relation classification
   - Use pre-trained models like REBEL

**Priority**: Start with #1 (rule-based), add #2 if needed

---

#### 2.2 Entity Disambiguation & Linking ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Current problem**: "America" (country) vs "America" (continent) vs "Captain America"

**Implementation:**
```python
class EntityLinker:
    """Link entities to canonical IDs."""
    
    def disambiguate_entities(self, entities, contexts):
        """Resolve ambiguous entities using context."""
        # Use entity types + context to disambiguate
    
    def link_to_wikidata(self, entities):
        """Link entities to Wikidata QIDs."""
        # Optional: requires API calls or local DB
```

**Simple approach:**
- Use entity type + context to create canonical IDs
- "America" (GPE, context: "president") ‚Üí "United States"
- "America" (LOC, context: "continent") ‚Üí "Americas"

**Advanced approach:**
- Entity linking to Wikidata/Wikipedia
- Maintains QID for each entity
- Enables cross-dataset entity matching

---

#### 2.3 Narrative & Conspiracy Detection ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Use case**: Detect coordinated narratives, conspiracy theories, information operations

**Implementation:**
```python
class NarrativeDetector:
    """Detect narrative structures in KGs."""
    
    def find_entity_chains(self, min_length=3):
        """Find multi-hop entity chains."""
        # "CIA ‚Üí Venezuela ‚Üí Oil ‚Üí War"
        # Output: chains.csv
    
    def detect_recurring_patterns(self, min_support=5):
        """Find frequent subgraphs (motifs)."""
        # e.g., "X opposes Y, Y supports Z" pattern
    
    def find_bridge_entities(self):
        """Entities connecting different communities."""
        # High betweenness centrality entities
```

**Applications:**
- Conspiracy theory detection (specific chain patterns)
- Information operation detection (coordinated entity co-mentions)
- Narrative framing analysis (how entities are connected)

---

#### 2.4 Quality Metrics & Validation ‚≠ê
**Critical for publication-quality research**

**Implementation:**
```python
class KGValidator:
    """Quality metrics for KG extraction."""
    
    def compute_precision_recall(self, gold_standard):
        """Compare against hand-labeled data."""
    
    def compute_entity_confidence(self):
        """Per-entity extraction confidence scores."""
        # Based on: frequency, context clarity, NER confidence
    
    def detect_extraction_errors(self):
        """Find likely false positives."""
        # Unusual entity types, very rare entities, etc.
    
    def generate_validation_sample(self, n=100):
        """Sample entities for manual validation."""
        # Stratified by frequency, type, confidence
```

**Outputs:**
- `kg_quality_report.json` - Overall metrics
- `validation_sample.csv` - Entities to manually check
- `confidence_scores.csv` - Per-entity confidence

## üöÄ Quick Wins (Can Do This Week)

### 1. Add `--group-by-time` to KG CLI
**Effort**: 2 hours  
**Impact**: Medium

```bash
python -m src.semantic.kg_cli \
  --input data.csv \
  --outdir output \
  --group-by-time daily \
  --time-col created_at
```

Output: `kg_nodes_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`, `kg_edges_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` for each day

### 2. Add Entity Metadata to Output
**Effort**: 1 hour  
**Impact**: Medium

Add to nodes.csv:
- `first_mention_context` - sample text where entity first appears
- `n_unique_contexts` - how many different documents mention it
- `avg_chars_per_mention` - context size (indicates detail level)

### 3. Create "KG Summary Report"
**Effort**: 2 hours  
**Impact**: High (helps users understand their data)

Auto-generate `kg_report.md` with:
- Entity type distribution (bar chart)
- Top entities by frequency (table)
- Relation type distribution (bar chart)
- Sample entity chains (text)
- Quality flags (e.g., "Low entity diversity - 80% are NORP")

### 4. Add Simple Sentiment (VADER)
**Effort**: 3 hours  
**Impact**: High

```python
pip install vaderSentiment
```

Add `--add-sentiment` flag to kg_cli that computes sentiment for each entity context.

Output: `entity_sentiment.csv` with avg/std sentiment per entity

## üìù Notes & Considerations

### Design Principles
1. **Modularity**: Each feature is optional, can be used independently
2. **Backwards compatibility**: Don't break existing pipelines
3. **Sensible defaults**: Works well out-of-box for most use cases
4. **Clear documentation**: Non-experts can use it

### Known Limitations
- NER quality depends heavily on domain (news > social media)
- Dependency parsing is slow and doesn't scale well
- Sentiment analysis has cultural/domain bias
- Entity linking requires external knowledge bases

### Open Questions
1. Should we support multiple NER models in parallel?
2. How to handle very large KGs (>1M entities)?
3. Should we build a web interface or CLI is enough?
4. What's the minimum viable validation pipeline?
